<h2>Why study molecular plant sciences</h2>
<div class="mps-home-intro">
  <p>Plants support most life on earth. They are the foundation of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and provide essential services and materials to people. Molecular plant scientists study the genetic, biophysical, and biochemical processes that plants use to capture solar energy and use it to biosynthesize food, fuel, wood and paper, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. Fundamental molecular plant science knowledge is critical for:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Improving<strong> agricultural productivity</strong> and sustainability</li>
      <li>Developing new <strong>renewable energy</strong> sources</li>
      <li>Making <strong>novel compounds</strong> to improve human health and diet</li>
      <li>Improving <strong>plant responses to environmental challenges</strong></li>
    </ol>
